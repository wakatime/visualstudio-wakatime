# Work folder enhancement

Sometimes it makes sense to monitor activity only on a subset of projects/solutions. For these situations the environemnt variable WAKATIME_WORKFOLDER has been introduced.
You can specify a path to your working folder, i.e. c:\mywork. Now, only activity on assets in the folder or its descendands gets monitored.
If you leave the variable undefined or empty, the plugin behaves as before.
